        <p><strong>var</strong> has function scope and is hoisted.
            <strong>let</strong> and const have block scope and are not hoisted.
            <strong>const</strong> additionally prevents reassignment of the variable, but it does not make the value immutable (in case of objects and arrays).

            In general, <strong>null</strong> is typically used when you want to explicitly represent the absence of a value, while <strong>undefined</strong> often arises in situations where a value is expected but not provided or when dealing with uninitialized variables and missing object properties. Understanding these distinctions is important for writing clean and reliable JavaScript code.

            REST APIs are widely used in web and mobile application development as they provide a simple and standardized way for clients to communicate with server resources over the internet. They are the foundation for many modern web services and are known for their simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration into various platforms and programming languages.
